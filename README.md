# Trillo-Project
Trillo Project - Learning of Advanced CSS techniques
In this project I learned the flexbox technique.
Entire project was coded using flexbox technique. It is a single page application for hotel booking app.
Again this project was a part of Advanced CSS course by Jonas on Udemy Platform.

## Techniques I learned from this project
* Flexbox utility for placing the element at desired place.
* Achivement of responsiveness of web page using less media queries.
* Advanced animation techniques
